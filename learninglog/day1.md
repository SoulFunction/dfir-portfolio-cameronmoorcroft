# Day 1 – LAN & Network Basics

- Ran `ipconfig` and identified my IPv4, subnet mask and default gateway.
- Learned what a LAN is and how devices talk on it.
- Used `arp -a` to see IP → MAC mappings on my network.
- Installed Wireshark and captured ICMP traffic using `ping`.
- Applied `icmp` and `arp` filters in Wireshark to see live LAN traffic.
- Started setting up this DFIR portfolio repo on GitHub.
